# Product-feature-extractor
This project automatically identifies product features from customer reviews, helping businesses understand what people are saying about their products. It extracts key aspects like "camera quality" or "battery life" and summarizes whether these are liked or disliked.

By using prompt-based extraction with the FLAN-T5 model in Google Colaboratory, the project provides a streamlined way for companies to gain valuable insights from large volumes of review data, enabling them to make informed decisions for product improvement.
