"Jace Rankin may be short, but he's nothing to mess with, as the man who was just hauled out of the saloon by the undertaker knows now. He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla ""Kyle"" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words. I had to mentally edit as I read for some sentences to make sense. It wasn't too too bad, but it was a little distracting.","Rankin is a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is"
Great short read.  I didn't want to put it down so I read it all in one sitting.

"I'll start by saying this is the first of four books so I wasn't expecting it to &#34;conclude&#34;. It centers on 3 children, Alex and his younger brother Argus, and Alex's friend, Sapphire. They find a name on a bus map that they can't find and so the mystery starts. Well written with good character development although lots of room still for more.It's quite a short book so I will be moving onto book 2 swiftly.","It centers on 3 children, Alex and his younger brother Argus, and Alex's friend Sapphire.

"Aggie is Angela Lansbury who carries pocketbooks instead of writing them. While this light murder mystery is laced with misdirections, the clues lead to a rather obvious cliche of an ending.

"Aislinn is a little girl with big dreams. After the death of her older brother, she decides to follow in his footsteps and become a lady knight. Her quest for knighthood brings many challenges and the temptation of forbidden love. Aislinn learns that being a knight means putting the Kingdom in front of personal concerns and helping those that cannot help themselves. In a journey is fraught with danger and filled with adventure, Aislinn is forced to grow up fast. She must stay strong and develop the skills necessary to realize her lifelong dream.With sword fights, passionate love, mythical creatures, and courtly games, Woman of Honor is my kind of book. I love the idea of incorporating real history in fantasy, and Ms. Zoltack's book is based on the real life story of a group of female knights. Blending history with fiction, her writing is full of plot and adventure and her characters are strong and believable. Most of all, I grew to love all of them and cared about their hardships and successes.Aislinn is quite the main protagonist. She's tenacious and bold, beautiful and strong. The romance that blooms between her and the prince is well developed after years of solid friendship and teasing. I enjoyed reading about their secret courtship and had no idea how their romance would turn out! Ms. Zoltack has a few twists in store that will shock and startle as well as please.In conclusion, I thoroughly recommend this book for everyone that enjoys fantasy, romance and adventure! I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel, Knight of Glory.","Aislinn is a little girl with big dreams.

"I got this because I like collaborated short stories. Alot of times when two good writers put their heads together, the results turn out well. This is the case with this short story. The writers take an age old lesson and turn it into a good read. It begins with, as they call it, Crazy #1 who is picking up a hitchhiker and from there it gets graphic and a little much for my taste. Then it cuts to Nutcase #2 who is hitchhiking. They inevitably get together and the results are suspenseful. The ending I felt was well deserved on both accounts.I also watched the video of the two authors on how they decided to break this short story up and the idea was cool. One wrote their side for scenario 1 and the other did scenario 2 without talking with each other about how tier side was going. Then, when it came for them to bring the two pieces together, they made them fit perfectly. I think it took great talent for two authors to take their two seperate stories and merge them as well as they did.The story does have some pretty graphic details which is forwarned, but if you don't mind a little detail for a short story, then definitely pick this one up.","""I got this because I like collaborated short stories.

"I just finished a re-read of WICKED GARDEN and all I can say is WOW!!!, even in a novella Lorelei James can write stories so hot your e-reader starts smokin!WICKED GARDEN is a short story about lost loves reuniting with a little extra sumthin, sumthin. Billy Buchanan returns to Spearfish as a favor for a business associate.  He agreed as a favor but also because it would give him a chance to re-ignite the spark from his high school flame Eden LaCroix.  For the past ten years he has regretted walking away from Eden. Eden has spent the last ten years building a career and dedicated to the local community center helping at risk kids.  She hasn't had time for real relationships, just the occasional no strings attached hook ups with sexy Native American rock star Jon White Feather.When Billy and Eden see each other for the first time in ten years the chemistry spikes off the charts but Eden is determined to fight it because Billy is working on a project that could destroy her job.  He quickly sweet talks her into seeing him out side the project.  As things heat up between Eden and Billy and they are both realizing they still have strong feelings for each other...dunh dunh dunh....Jon comes home for a couple of days.  Billy and Jon decide they want to give Eden one of her darkest fantasies. BOY O BOY is this a hot menage!I really like Eden, even though she is worried about her heart and Billy leaving her again, she takes charge of her sexuality and is not scared to go after what she wants sexually.  As much as I liked Eden in this story, it is Billy and Jon who stole the story for me.  Both men are sexy and strong.  Billy is possessive, sexy, dominant and vulnerable, I absolutely adore the way he treats Eden and some of the insecurities he displays.  JON...oh my, he is my favorite, don't get me wrong I love Billy, but the way Jon treats Eden before, during and after the menage just melts my heart (among other things), Not to mention Jon is a sexy rock star.  I am over the moon excited that Jon is getting his own novella BALLROOM BLITZ, release date 10/2/12.Folks...let me tell you...if I could get the action that went on in the work out room in WICKED GARDEN I would be in the work out room five to ten times a day!WICKED GARDEN is a great novella perfect for an afternoon when you want to escape for a few hours.  A bonus is we get to see how sexy Lorelei writes non-cowboys, yep be it in a cowboy hat or a suit  Ms. James knows how to write sexy as hell heroes!","WICKED GARDEN is a short story about lost loves reuniting with a little extra sumthin, sumthin.

"I was very disappointed with this book... not because I have anything against blonds (I am one), but because I figured that out of 500 jokes, there HAD to be some good laughs. I was wrong. First, I didn't count them, but I'd be real surprised if there were even 200 jokes in this book. Second, among those 200 possible jokes, at least 50 were repeated 2 or more time in different parts of the book. It's almost as if the writer kept a running list of jokes as he heard them, with no real concern about whether or not they might already have been recorded. Then he decided there MUST be at least 500 jokes here. Finally, to be perfectly frank with you, I do not recall laughing at a single one of these ""jokes"". Most were better described as insults, mistaking the degradation of a group of people for humor. Very ""7th Grade"" material. Don't bother with this one. It's not worth the 99 cents.

"How many times is author going to get Amazon to delete this or add comments about alleged conspiracies of people out to get him? Is he f*in delusional? My review:I have to agree with a few previous reviewers. The author doesn't know the basic mechanics of writing, so how in the world is this or any other he's written full stars? There's not a page that isn't filled with grammar problems. The story itself suffers the same problems from the author's inattention to detail. Characters are inconsistent in their actions.

"This was my first with this author. I thoroughly enjoyed it.I have to say the concept of dragon, elves and djinn being at war is new to me. Theres usually a truce in place. That elves and djinn team up to eliminate dragon mates, in an attempt to wipe out the dragon race was refreshing to read. Story wise I mean.Scarlet is a pop star. She has been in hiding for 7 years.Janos is a dragon. He is also an elder.Scarlet is his mate. Janos must protect her till he can impregnate her. Once that is accomplished he can change her thus giving her a way to protect herself.The story was too short. Only 90 pages. Still a lot was told in such a short space. Looking forward to continuing the saga in the next book.","This was my first with this author. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have to say the concept of dragon, elves and djinn being at war is new to me.

"This was my first Anya Bast book and I really liked it. I have looked at some of her other reads but her books seems a little too far fetched for me but to each his own. What makes this book so different from other menage stories is that the author took the time to really develop her characters. The men got to know their woman. They did not claim her and wisk her off and screw like bunnies 24/7. They took the time to woo her, they loved her, respected her, and they honored her. I also loved the fact that it was quite ways into the book before they actually had sex. This was a great read and one I would highly recommend! I would have loved more action and intrigue but for the most part I loved it. I hope this books becomes a series. Great job Ms. Bast.","""It was my first Anya Bast book and I really liked it.

"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful, but she is strong, compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate, but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in, but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.

"What's the difference between a guy and a man?  Willingness to take a risk on a relationship with a woman.  Of course, he's hot, she's hot, and the physical attraction is explosive and enjoyable.  That will earn 3 stars in this genre.  What earned the 4th star is the quality of the characterization and the interaction between the various characters in the book.The book is a quick, short read.

"This short story is very confusing.I have no issue with unreliable narrators, but it is difficult to tell what is happening in this story because the writing is too poor for readers to be able to draw any conclusions.  Virtually everybody in the story has difficulty relating to others.  Conversations begin and then trail off without any important information being related.  The author doesn't prevent any ""normal"" interactions for us to be able to judge if the characters are the ones who have difficult understanding normal human interactions or if the problem actually is with him.  I had assumed that a main character was mentally unbalanced and waiting for that to develop throughout the story.  However, when the story ended, apparently he had become ""normal,"" making a very unfulfilling conclusion.  Why set up a ""weird"" situation for a short story with all this foreshadowing and then leave it unexplored and unexplained?  The only way the author can advance the story is to tell us -- in simple sentences -- what type of people the characters are (things like:  He was a nice person.  He liked people.  He didn't know why, that was just the way he was).  We're never shown anything through the action of the story.  People are just put in situations, have weird, trailing-off conversations, and then we're subjected to basic statements about the type of people that they are.The environment isn't very realistic either.  Because of some odd wording, I thought at first that maybe the story was set in another country -- but then a character mentions being from ""Michigan,"" which is the only sense of place we got in the story.  We know we're not in Michigan and we're in a city.  Don't hope for anything more specific.  It's a place where a independent office supply story is still in business (and can afford to pay ten dollars an hour for part time help) -- but is it in modern times?  Don't hope for anything specific, because it won't be happening.The characters seem not to know things that we would know.  For example, a character was in ""the war"" and has returned home and worked another type of job.  Later, ""old bruises"" on his face are thought by other characters to be from ""the war.""  However, human healing doesn't work that way and all humans should be aware of that.  Bruises, even ""old"" ones, have to be relatively recent and not from old trauma.The experience of reading this story is kind of like if another species was writing about humans and their interactions.  We know we don't act that way, but to a elephant, these interactions might make sense.The proofreading is better than some earlier reviews stated (I'm going to guess issues were corrected), but still not a professional job.","This short story is very confusing.I have no issue with unreliable narrators, but it is difficult to tell what is happening in this story because the writing is too poor for readers to be able to draw any conclusions.

"Amy Parker is going to Hawaii the week before Christmas on business. She has had to give up sex and relationships to focus on her career. Justin Garrett is her traveling companion and associate at the law firm.  If they didn't work together, she'd definitely do him. On the plane she boldly masturbates in the seat next to him while he's supposedly napping, but he hears everything and it makes him hard. Before they left for this trip, he accidentally found a racy email to her friend on her laptop, and he knows she wants him and he knows her deepest, darkest desires. He plans to do something about it in Hawaii.They meet with their client, Mitch Magruder, who Justin apprenticed with before going to his current job. Mitch and Justin share a friendly camaraderie, and Justin knows he can count on Mitch to help fulfill Amy's fantasy. Between the two of them, they work to get Amy to relax and unwind. But can Justin get her to relax enough to give him her heart?In Unwrapped, Jaci Burton paints a vivid picture of the two men coaxing Amy into letting herself go, and letting them both seduce her. Readers will enjoy a molten-hot m&eacute;nage scene and the exquisite feeling of finally being intimate with someone you've fantasized about for years. As with all of Ms. Burton's books, this is power packed with emotion and sensuality. I love her style and how she creates believable, intelligent characters.

"These stories aren't written badly, but they struck me as emotionally ""off"" or tone deaf.  Fiction about abuse -- whether physical or emotional -- can take us places that are difficult, places that are unfamiliar or maybe sadly familiar.  But in each story, I found myself thinking that people wouldn't act that way or think that way -- things were a little too pat, a little too rushed.  Language was a bit careless, observations were a little bit off.It's hard to specify exactly what seemed off about these stories but it was almost as if I was reading a collection of stories written by somebody who hadn't had much more exposure to father/child dynamics than watching a Lifetime movie marathon.","These stories aren't written badly, but they struck me as emotionally ""off"" or tone deaf.

"I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear, pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to reassure him -at exactly the same times Aidan touched Warwick. Don't get me wrong, Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you! She is a one WOMAN rescue squad that is the perfect match for our mysterious- masked hired guard Warwick. The sex between them is hot and wicked as well.enjoy!","""I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear, pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to "
"This book is a deserving winner of the prestigious Giller prize in 2008.  I've been wanting to read it for some time, but wanted to read Boyden's first book ""Three Day Road"" first.  As good as that book was, this one is even better.  But it was good to read Three Day Road first as it is a precursor to this one and helped me understand the characters a bit more.  Like Three Day Road, this book is so difficult to read in some ways because you keep waiting for the terrible, cataclysmic thing to happen.  And even though you know it's going to happen, it doesn't make it any less terrible when it does.  This book is also similar to Three Day Road as it told from the viewpoints of two different people.  Both Will and his young niece Annie have terrible stories to tell and each heals through the sharing of them.  I highly recommend this book, but I would suggest that you read Three Day Road first.  You will feel richer from the experience of enjoying superlative story telling.  Both books will take you up and out of your everyday life and into a magical world that seems so very real while you are there reading about it.","This book is a deserving winner of the prestigious Giller prize in 2008.

"The Amazon's Curse built on relationships and events that developed in The Vampire's Bride by Showalter. The book can stand alone but is so much better if you know the back story. My rating would have been different if I hadn't already connected with the characters while reading the previous book.The Vampire's Bride focuses on Layel, king of the vampires, and Delilah, an Amazon warrior. However, we are introduced to many other characters, including Zane & Nola. I was happy to find out how their story ended.I would not suggest using this book alone as an introduction to Showalter's writing.

"I like dragons, and this was a free download, so I gave it a try. Aside from needing editing (or at least some proofreading) to clear up the clunky storytelling, I found myself disappointed. The story starts slow, works up unevenly to a burst of action... only to end not with a conclusion, but with an out-of-the-blue jump into the premise of the Dragonseer Saga series. That was halfway through the download: the other half turned out to be a preview of the first full-length Dragoneers book. Even knowing that it was a prequel, even knowing that it was a novella, I'd hoped for a more complete, self-contained tale, not what amounted to an overlong Prologue. I didn't bother with the preview; if this novella is an accurate indicator of the author's style and sense of story, I already know the Dragonseer Saga won't be on my reading list anytime soon.","I like dragons, and this was a free download, so I gave it a try.

"The first book in The Watchers series is an intriguing and fascinating vampire world.After escaping years of abuse as the prisoner of a brutal drug lord, Robyn Andrews boards the first bus out of town and heads for Louisville, Kentucky where a chance encounter with a stranger changes her life for the better? Watchers have one mission in life; to hunt and eliminate Rogue vampires and Trigg just wants to be left alone and do his job.  But he can&#8217;t seem to harden his heart against the petite woman who looks so lost standing in the rain.  He knows that that a future for them is impossible, she&#8217;s human, he&#8217;s a vampire, but she&#8217;s someone special. But the past is catching up and it has a way of changing destinies.This steady to fast paced plot keeps the reader engaged from beginning to end with well written scenes, vivid images and great compelling characters.  The author does such a fantastic job of giving these characters life that the reader can&#8217;t help but become enamored and want to know more.  As the reader gets caught up in the lives of Trigg and Robyn they are swept along with the Watchers missions as they battle the rogues and get their adrenalin pumping.The attraction between Trigg and Robyn is such a sweet passion that burns super hot at the same time.  The author conveys that chemistry and their relationship with such intensity that it captures the imagination. The reader can&#8217;t help but feel for these two characters, Robyn&#8217;s such a strong and sweet person that has been through hell and Trigg is this tough vampire that has such tender feelings for this lost waif, how can the reader not fall in love with them.  Even the sex scenes are contradictory in the fact that he is so sweet and tender but carries away by hot steamy lust that it takes the reader&#8217;s breath away.I can&#8217;t wait to read the next book in this wonderful and entertaining vampire world, Vane, Rosa and Rayne have definitely caught my attention and I want to know more about them as well as the Watchers.","The first book in The Watchers series is an intriguing and fascinating vampire world.

"This book was a complete waste of, what, $2.  Not to mention the time I spent trying to read it.  Too bad, the story line had some potential but what a bunch of poorly written drivel!  And the redundancy of the speech in the book!  WOW.  The book it written from so many points of view it's hard to tell who's speaking when.  Don't get me wrong, I know it's a romance novel but c'mon!  It looks like I'm the only one who thought this book was so horrible and I won't apologize for warning you away.  This book is only for the HORRIBLY sappy sugary kind of reading.  I think I actually gained 5 lbs and a couple of cavities from reading what I did get through.","This book was a complete waste of, what, $2. Not to mention the time I spent trying to read it.

"JT Summers was in trouble.  He lusted after his friends little sister, and he was not happy about it at all.  He was supposed to be her protector, but who would save Nikki Durant from him?  He knew that she wanted him just like she knew he was equally affected.  When Nikki got herself arrested just to be near him, and JT resisted her once again, she pulled out all stops and went to her friend Jasmine for help.When JT arrived at Sweetwater Ranch to take Jasmine up on the swim she invited him for, he was horrified to find Nikki sunbathing in the nude.  He knew at that moment he had been had. After a very erotic encounter, JT couldn't get Nikki out of his mind.  When she showed up at his office during a rainstorm, and started stripping in his office, he knew he was in deep.  There was no way he could resist her, and he didn't even try.  It wasn't until after their first encounter that he realized he had taken her virginity, and he had all but called her an easy whore.JT didn't know if they even had a name for how badly he had screwed up.  Nikki had saved herself for him, and he had treated her horribly.  He had tried to see her, but Jasmine, Seth, and Zane had prevented him from getting anywhere near her.  He knew he was late in figuring it out, but he was in love with her, and was going to win her back.Another winner by MB!!  I like Nikki.  She is brash, sassy, and goes after what she wants at full steam.  No half way with her.  JT was fighting himself.  He loves Nikki, but is overwhelmed with obligation, and promises made to her brother.  JT promised to protect her in her brother's absence, but was loving her instead.

"Other reviewers were right on the money when they pointed out that this book could have benefited tremendously from quality editing, particularly if the editor had the sense to tell the author that some of his writing quirks were patently ridiculous. The main characters' first and last names are used nearly every time they are mentioned, and they call each other by first and last name almost as often. If that was intended to be cute mannerism it didn't work.Large portions of this book were completely unrealistic and disjointed, even for a book that one automatically approaches with a certain level of suspended belief. The characters should have had potential, but never lived up to it.The (very small) part about them actually finding the ark was interesting, but also completely failed to live up to its potential. It was surprisingly brief and largely ignored for the rest of the book, despite supposedly being at the center of the story. I finished the book, but won't read anything else by this author and suggest other readers not waste their time.","The main characters' first and last names are used nearly every time they are mentioned, and they call each other by first and last name almost as often.

"Quinn and Libby McKay had been together for fourteen years, but for the last three months, Libby had been living by herself after kicking her husband out.  She couldn't go on the way they had been.  They were no more than roommates, and she decided to either shake things up, or let go and move on.  It had truly shocked her that he seemed to take it in stride until he saw her dancing with someone else one night at Ziggy's.  Quinn had lost his temper, and that gave her some hope, but when he walked away not wanting to cause a scene, she was ready to give up.When Quinn showed up at the library waiting at her car, Libby didn't know what to think.  Hearing him ask for a second chance, and his proposition that she spend a weekend alone with him, she didn't know what to think.  Libby was further surprised to hear his agreement that he would give her time to think after their time together that was uninterrupted and free from pressure.  They had been so far apart from each other the past year that Libby was afraid to get her hopes up.  Knowing this was their last chance, she skeptically agreed.This was a different spin in that we witness the demise of a good marriage between two basically kind hearted people.  They allowed other issues come between them, and instead of tackling them head on, they tried to deal with them alone separating them farther.  Can these two find the path back to each other?  A good read with strong characters.

"It's Friday night again, and Hailey Jennison joins her friends for an evening of group voyeurism as the hunk across the way from her friend's apartment struts his stuff in his own place.But this time, they get caught.  And Hailey is the one who will bear Gage's punishment of choice - an evening out with him!OK, Gage admits it is blackmail, but he has been waiting months for a chance to get the beautiful but skittish Hailey to go out with him, and when this opportunity comes, he grabs it!  Much like he'd like to grab her...Never has blackmail looked so dang good!  Marie Harte's newest release with Samhain Publishing, Enjoying the Show leaves me wondering if I should take up voyeurism as a hobby myself!  And if I had a neighbor like Gage Warren, I think I just might.  After all, it worked out very well for Hailey, did it not?  lolDespite the blackmail, Gage certainly never forces Hailey into anything she does not want.  In fact, he goes out of his way to leave her with choices, needing her to realize how much she cares for him and that this is not just a temporary sexual fling, but a real relationship to him.Although she trusts Gage, Hailey is nevertheless slow to trust his feelings for her as anything more than transient.  But having gotten her attention with some really great sex, Gage easily wins her heart with his unending patience and the ways he shows her how much she means to him as a person and friend, instead of just a bed partner.Every time I read another Marie Harte story, I become a bigger fan of this talented author.  After the holidays are over, I am sure I will be splurging on her backlist!

This is all good and a well-needed change from the last book.Her husband is pou

Storyline could have been better and it was slow. It took to long to get to the threesome. As long as it it VERY cheap it is somewhat worth it.,It took to long to get to the threesome. As long as it it VERY cheap it is somewhat worth it.

"Because there really are very few good liberal/progressive publications available for the Kindle (or anywhere, for that matter), I subscribe to/support two ""political"" Kindle periodicals, The Nation and DailyKos. (For the more right-wing fare, I go read it free online.)The Nation's issues are well organized, sometimes thematically linked, and the articles well written with ample depth. I find myself learning about global issues that normally are not even touched on in the usual ""lowest common denominator"" fare on TV. Happenings in the arts and sciences are also covered.The Nation comes out once a week, which I find to be a good rate of publication for a magazine of this type. You don't get the breathless ""breaking news"" type of reporting (a la Wolf Blitzer) in The Nation, which I find refreshing, but the issues are current and usually of considerable importance. The editors have time to be editors and the writers have time to do their homework. It's a more measured, intelligent approach to the world than we've gotten used to with cable news and screaming-head blogs.I do not find The Nation to be all that left-wing. On the contrary, I find a balance of perspectives from left (mostly left-of-center) to center-right. Importantly, there are no ""Screaming of the Extremists"" portions. There are well-articulated viewpoints and the occasional intelligent debate. I'd like to see more of that tone in our general discourse.The Nation works great on the Kindle, and I find it very easy to get around each issue. So far, I have not encountered any typos either! I appreciate the work that goes into each issue.","The Nation's issues are well organized, sometimes thematically linked, and the articles well written with ample depth.

"Author and editors should do a better job of proofing -- especially for word usage.  Lots of misuses of ""then"" and ""than,"" ""passed"" and ""past,"" and ""accept"" and ""except.""  These errors were found throughout all three books.Aside from that, the characters were mercurial, and prone to over-blown prose; the dialog was easy to follow, if occasionally overwrought; the philosophical discussions were completely pedestrian (how many times will ""free will"" versus ""fate"" be debated?!?); the characters were sometimes inconsistent, sometimes too stiff, and other times quite engaging; and often the foreshadowing was heavy-handed.Even with all these faults, I enjoyed reading the series.","The author and editors should do a better job of proofing -- especially for word usage.
