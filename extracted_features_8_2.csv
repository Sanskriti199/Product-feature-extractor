"This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club. I loved the story then and I bet a dollar to a donut I will love it again. If my memory serves, I bought this book in 5th grade. That would have been about 1961. I am looking forward to reliving the memories.","This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club.

"When I read the description for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Once I downloaded it to my Kindle, I found it extremely hard to keep reading it.  To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.  I finally stopped torturing myself because I realized it wasn't going to get any better.","Neither Jada nor Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too everything is perfect'.

"I just had to edit this review. This book is an (I believe I got this right) an updated re-write. Thank god I didn't get the first version. It has moved into MY top 5 favorite. He (BECHETT DeSAXBY) is also in my top 5 Hero/daydream inducing gents.Didn't expect to like it. Seemed a little too debauched. ha ha ha. I freggin loved it. Matter of fact I'm over 21...well over 21...ran my batteries dead..NOW you know what batteries..I am broadening my reading tastes and buying anything Scottie Barrett writes. AN ABSOLUTE KEEPER (with a large supply of batteries).And for once the cover of that hunk matched the description. You guys can read it premise. What I loved is his portrayal and the FILET MIGNON in depth character study Scottie Barrett did. From the first, with 'Bechett baby' catchin a snooze in the hayloft after an early ""happy ending"" thats AFTER HE WENT OUT AND BROUGHT BACK HIS CASTLE'S meat for the week. At first he seemed like a wastrel. But he's the real deal. In modern times he would be a war hero. He's home from the crusades. He didn't think he would survive. The King suitably and righteously rewards him. He's in his early 30's. Very responsible and loving and enjoyin life. (HELL, I'M WELL OVER 21 AND I'D DO THE SAME THING)He earned it. It's his choice. And he takes it to the max.As I said I'm not doing story premise, but it's about 3 friends. 2 boys and 1 girl. Bechett baby is one of the boys, then his cousin (the other boy) and a girl.They were all raised together. He fell in love with the girl as children. Then life happens. The first scene AFTER he gets her back inside the castle walls...well....hmmmm, hmmmm, hmmmm.She is tricked into delivering some refreshments to his bedroom..and she walks in on a REAL TREAT! CRIPES MY OWN HEART RATE JUST PICKED UP,HONESTLY! For the faint of heart, she walks in on a Mfff, Ah-hem (can't breath)...she's stuck on stupid..I'm not! I must have read this scene 100 times and it still hasn't gotton old. I can just see his face when he turns around...luv,luv,luved it! So there's my re-wright. I've re-read this 3x's. I've only done that with 3 other books. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVED THIS ONE. And for those of you whe know me from the other Amazon sites know I'm no shrinkin violet.So those of you who read the 1st version..throw it out..try this! YES YES YES this is a keeper,a heat inducer, and in MY top 5. (Now let's see where did I put my new toy?",The book is an (I believe I got this right) an updated re-write. Thank god I didn't get the first version. It has moved into MY top 5 favorite. He (BECHETT DeSAXBY
"I don't normally buy 'mystery' novels because I just don't like them.  However, this time I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did.I found the story engrossing, the characters engaging, and it was well written.

"This isn't the kind of book I normally read, although I try not to limit myself to certain genres. Sometimes I find epic fantasies a little tedious. Not so with this one! There wasn't one paragraph in this story that didn't hold my interest. Ty Johnston has a wonderful way with words so that his scenes come alive for the reader. I'm definitely buying books two and three of this trilogy!","This isn't the kind of book I normally read, although I try not to limit myself to certain genres.

"I really enjoyed how this story developed.  Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human.  The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction wasn't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path.  He is startled by Povre's differences when he first sees them, but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit.  Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent's emotions.  At first his anger frightens her, but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise, the rest of the story's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons.  And at the same time, they grow closer knowing that Povre's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she'll be discovered and captured.From time to time, the story shifts to a third character, Povre's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group.  He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter's absence.  He knows that if she is captured, she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic, but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre.  They really were good together.  He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through.  Povre helped heal Kent's bruised heart, gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature.  What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible, this truly is an alien romance.  They really saw each other's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance.","""I really enjoyed how this story developed.

"I bought this book because I loved the cover and I try to read any Civil War romance I come across. Unfortunately, I wanted more story. If the book was longer to compensate for all the bedroom activity it would be a much better read. Both the Confederate Colonel and the Southern widow were good characters and relatable, but were only written at a surface level because not enough time was given to development. At least the readers were given memories from their past to help fill in some of the blanks. And the epilogue detracted from the story in my opinion.I like Debra Glass, but this wasn't my favorite read.","""I bought this book because I loved the cover and I try to read any Civil War romance I come across.

This was a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from the beginning to the end. The story line was full of details and kept me involved and entertained. I loved the characters and their quirks. The story was smoothly written . Secret agents and art. Who would have believed how much fun and add a twist of fate and  love.I will read this author again.Enjoy this book you won't be disappointed.,This is a book that I thoroughly enjoyed from the beginning to the end.

"If the first entry into the series was a toddler's first clumsy attempts at walking, then the second book in the Bewitching Mysteries series shows that the books are quickly maturing into a series worth reading.The plotline of this book has Maggie plunged headfirst into yet another murder mystery in her hometown. When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5","The first entry into the series was a toddler's first clumsy attempts at walking, then the second book in the Bewitching Mysteries series shows that the books are quickly maturing into a series worth reading."
"I bought this set and returned it.  I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.  ( They are bundled out of order, too).  The writing and phrasing was so immature that I thought at first it was a satire!  But the pages and pages of supposedly erotic fantasy stuffing the book to bring up the word count was the final blow.  No character development, not enough background.  What should have been interesting read like a pre- teen fantasy.  Don't waste your money.","I bought this set and returned it. I couldn't force myself to finish the first book, A Touch of Silk.

"I read mixed reviews on Kiss and Kin But I love Kinsey Holley so I decided I need to make my own opinion and I'm very happy I did :)In this novella Bk. 1 of Werewolves in Love Series she introduces us to Taran and Lark (gotta love the names) who by chance happen to be cousins through marriage not blood. Both these tortured individuals happen to be in love with each other but don't know what to do about for several reasons. I love the Taboo story line :)Lark gets herself into a bad position,GHB and an attempt on her life. When Taran comes to the rescue things progress and wow do they!When you read this story you feel intensity of their feelings towards each other and the struggle they both go through.I love how Kinsey portrays Lark, she is a strong character but falls apart when unsure of herself and Taran. This made her more real to me. And Taran WOW! a patient caring Alpha in cowboy boots :) Yummy.Can't wait to find out what happens next in Yours, Mine, and Howls.Check it out!! Kinsey W.

"The only thing that got me to the end of this story was sheer cussedness.  The storyline was flat, there was absolutely no character development, and the dialog was from a cheesy porn.  I found myself increasingly disgusted with the female lead and her whining.  In no way did I find myself sympathetic to the protagonist nor did I find myself even caring what made him who he was.  There was no back story to explain what brought the main characters to this point of the book.  And while I can suspend my belief with the best of them, I just wasn't buying it this time.","The storyline was flat, there was absolutely no character development, and the dialog was from a cheesy porn.

Love the paper. Great writers but cancelled my subscription due to the price. If the price comes down to like $12/mo I might buy it them. I do buy an occasional single issue for $.99 which I really like. Gave 5 stars for the papers content. I can't rate low due to the cost since I was aware of the cost when subscribing.,Love the paper.

"This is not a good ghost story, nor is it a romance. To me it was a poorly written Harlequin romance with a lot of smut thrown in.  The author doesn't appear to know what genre` she's trying to capture.There were numerous typos which I found annoying. The author also incorporated Elvis' name, but did it in a way that I found disrespectful as well as inaccurate. Stephen King she's NOT!If you're looking for a good ghost story, this isn't it. If you're looking for a romance novel, this isn't that either.It had the potential to be an interesting story, but instead turned out to be a mish-mash of ideas.I won't be looking for any other books from this author.","This is not a good ghost story, nor is it a romance.

"When I first came across Jonny Tangerine's Toe Popper I hesitated reading it because of the cover. I just kept visualizing this lady on the cover getting blown up. I think if the cover had just shown the water and sand etc. with no people on the cover I may have felt different and bought it. JMO. My family and friends and I had a discussion on covers and if any of us had not bought a book because of the cover and some of us said "" A picture is worth a thousand words"" and it is the first thing we see when seeing a book is it's cover and it gives an impression of what the book is about. I've come across 3 Kindle story covers that I hadn't bought until I asked my family and friends if any of them have read the story's.I read this story week's ago and am just getting time to write the review. This mystery was gifted to me by a friend who thought I would like it and I am glad that he did because I thoroughly got hooked with the many twists and turns and holding my breath at certain times in this mystery.Characters FBI agent Catherine (I was thrilled to see a strong female FBI lead character) and to know the background and turmoil that Major Joel Lane was going through. These two characters were striving to find out who the culprit was and to put a stop to this madness.I am looking forward to reading more from Jonny Tangerine and I hope there will be a book #2 to this novel.I recommendToe Popperto mystery/thriller readers.",The Toe Popper is one of the best books I've ever read.

"I read books not only because I love to read about new characters and their adventures, but also because I want to write. I am currently hard at work on the fourth rewrite of my manuscript, and some of the best places I look to for inspiration are other books. Seeing how the author flows the action, how they make the characters come alive, how they draw me in, gives me fresh ideas on how to make my own writing better. So when I read and review novels, I am not just reviewing as a reader, but also as a writer. I just wanted to add that little disclaimer before I get into my next review.Sammi Ever After, the debut novel from Soma Helmi has a great plot. Sammi, a young girl in her twenties, finds a friend from childhood and instantly falls in love, preparing to move across the world just to be with him. It's her fairy tale come true. Until she arrives at the airport only to find out she has been dumped- over an email. Fairy tale broken. When Sammi finally forces herself off her friend's couch and secures a job and new friends, she decides to take a little journey to try to search for that fairy tale ending. From London to Bali to Greece, Sammi gets tangled in sticky situations and personal revelations, and realizes that her Prince Charming may have been by her side the entire time.Like I said, I think the plot is fantastic. A great story about self-discovery and love, and I am a huge travel geek, so reading about all these destinations I hope to visit had me amped to read this story. But once I started, the writing fell flat to me. Helmi relied on flashbacks and back story when introducing characters, much that was simply not needed and unnecessary to the story. For each flashback, I felt myself became less engaged in the action. Another problem I had was the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I don't know anyone who would actually describe someone's look aloud by saying ""His sandy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes and the way his muscles ripple..."" That could be the thoughts of someone, but for a person (especially a young girl) to describe someone else that way? It just wasn't believable for me. So as much as I would have liked this plot and the characters that came along for the ride, I do not feel the writing did the story justice.","I read books not only because I love to read about new characters and their adventures, but also because I want to write.

It is a fast read, one that would be perfect for younger readers/teens with the right amount of fantasy and imagination without getting dragged out.

These dream friends accept him, respect him and encourage him.

"Brody Nash has the perfect idea for the one year anniversary of his relationship with his girlfriend Sidney - a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Drew.  Brody loves Sidney and sharing her with anyone would never have even come up if he hadn't noticed that some of her preferred reads involve m&eacute;nage relationships.Drew Buchanan isn't the settling down kind of guy and he never stays with any one woman for very long.  He leads more of a nomadic lifestyle and often sails off on his yacht aptly named `Sunset.'  He's a brilliant desert chef and creates his delectable treats for Brody's restaurant, The Blue Fish Grill, whenever he's in Graceville but he's finding it harder and harder to stay in town especially since he's in love with Sidney.Sidney McCall has always lived a nomadic lifestyle.  Her mother never stayed in one place very long and she simply continued the lifestyle she already knew - until she met Brody.  They quickly moved from the initial meeting to living together and even a year after the fact, Sidney still feels like it's all a dream.In celebration of their first anniversary together Sidney plans to surprise Brody with a delicious meal along with a sexy outfit when he returns home from the restaurant - and succeeds.  Brady had intended to tell Sidney that he'd invited Drew over and about his surprise but one look at her in her sexy dress and all his brain cells headed south.  Dinner's put on hold while they satisfy other hungers - until they hear the knock at the door and then Brody remembers that he still has to tell her about his `gift.'  Sidney can't deny an attraction to Drew and even though she isn't entirely comfortable with the idea of sex with two men at the same time it is a fantasy of hers and if it's alright with the men then who is she to argue.  Things turn decidedly odd afterwards and Sidney's not sure what to think about Drew's cold disinterested attitude and to make things even more complicated Brody notices her preoccupation and assumes that it's more than just friendly concern.Sami Lee delves into what could happen when the thing you fantasize about turns out to be the exact opposite of what you truly desire.  Sidney and Brody are deeply in love with each other but neither of them are truly certain of the others feelings.  I found the dynamics between these three characters to be oddly fascinating but at the same time understand why Drew's held himself apart from Brady and Sidney.  I'd love to know what happened with Drew after this story ends.  He's a special guy who deserves a little happiness in his life and a special woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",Bredy Nash has the perfect idea for the one year anniversary of his relationship with his girlfriend Sidney - a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Drew.

"Aside from the clich&eacute;d marathon sex in this book I was left pretty confused by the ending as to what exactly I had just read. Did she dream it? Does he recognized her? I'm not really complaining because it's free and I did enjoy reading it for the most part, but there was nothing very special about it and the ""twist"" if that's what you call it at the end really just left me scratching my head. A bit of fluff with not a lot of substance, this book is fine if you are just browsing for something free to read because there's really nothing more than that to it.","A bit of fluff with not a lot of substance, this book is fine if you are just browsing for something free to read because there's really nothing more than that to it."

"Apparently this is a prequel to the series.  I have read nothing of the series but bought the ""Lords of the Underworld"" bundle that has this book and the first three books.  I read a reviewer's note that said if you get the sample of this bundle that you will get the entire short story/prequel in that sample (word to the wise).  Of course that would only be helpful for people who have read the rest of the series and didn't want to buy the prequel.  For me, I just decided to delve into this series so I didn't mind getting it in the bundle.It has some pretty low reviews.  Normally I would never buy and probably wouldn't read a book or novella that has 3 stars.  I am pretty surprised it has such low reviews, but perhaps people were hoping for more from this prequel.This story is about the guardian to the gates of Hell (Geryon) and the goddess of oppression, Kadence who is in charging of maintaining the wall between the human realm and Hell.  The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.  Only the very end does it bring up Pandora's box (from what I can gather, the point of the story was to give us the background on Pandora's box, but I am not sure if Geryon or Kadence play any role in the rest of the books).I plan to read the next book, The Darkest Night next.

"You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised, a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover. The starting point of the story is one I already see in the past, a young and handsome College TA, Harlan, who has the hots for his even more handsome, a slightly older, College professor, Sawyer. The book respects the rules of a May / December romance plus the College setting with an Office Affairs theme... the shorten the thing, this is the classical romance by the rule, with the twist of being a gay romance. So I would say that it can appeal both to the old fan of the gay romance than to a newbie who wants to try her hand on the genre.Being Sawyer older and also Harlan's superior, he has all the trouble of the case: he can't take advantage of his position, he doesn't want to be involved with a younger man who can have everyone he wants, and plus there is also a little problem of appropriateness... Harlan to make the ends meet has a side job as a stripper in the local gay club, and Sawyer saw him at his workplace. So the point if Sawyer is gay is no more a question, but now there is the biggest problem that, even if Sawyer manages to move on the fact to have a relationship with a student, the fact that said student is a stripper is a big NO for the career of a college professor.And so Sawyer didn't make a move on Harlan, stopped to go to that club, and forced himself to have a strictly professional relationship with the boy. Only that Harlan is not of the same idea, and as soon as he reaches his graduation day, he is also ready, willing and naked for the professor to take. Harlan has all the cockiness of his young age, he is really convinced that Sawyer is avoiding him only since they have a professional relationship to preserve, and he thinks that, as soon as that problem is over, Sawyer will be all his to take. In a way I like how daring and careless Harlan is, but this only proves that he is really young.Being Harlan one of his students, it's not the only problem for Sawyer; there is also the question of his side job, as a stripper, that is not exactly a good visiting card to prove his willingness to commit and being exclusive; and then even if Harlan wants a real relationship, it's not said that Sawyer wants the same thing: he is arrived at an age where or you start to think seriously to commit, or you run at the minimum hint that there is a chance to be shackled... There is quite a controversy inside Sawyer, he is jealous of Harlan, mainly due to his job, but he is also skittish when it's time to commit and give something real to Harlan. Where Harlan is open and maybe careless, at least he has his mind clear and he knows what he wants... for all the years Sawyer has more than Harlan, he has not yet reached that level of maturity.Anyway this is a novella, mostly and erotic novella, with a lot of sex scenes, hot and nice, and all in all it spans only two days in the life of our characters, so there is not enough time to develop a lot, but I have the idea that the author has something more in mind, since she introduced some supporting characters (Harlan's brother, Rhys, and Sawyer's friend, Macon) that have too much deepness to be only a passing spectator.","You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised, a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover.

"Identical twin sisters Gwendolyn and Anora are complete opposites, but fierce friends nonetheless. Gwendolyn is the tomboy of the duo - even going so far as to cut her hair short and wear men's clothing, while Anora exudes a very feminine nature. As the eldest by minutes, Anora has been placed in an arranged marriage, but thankfully, it turned out to be a love match anyways. The night before her wedding, the two sneak out unchaperoned for one last sisterly moment of bonding, when the unthinkable happens and they are kidnapped by two wandering Vikings. They believe Gwendolyn to be male (in men's clothing and short hair) and take the duo back to their ship in repair, even though it is expressly forbidden by the captain, Hakon. From here on out, the story is about Hakon and his interaction with the 'brother' Garric and sister Anora. Gwendolyn continues her identity as Garric in hopes to keep Anora's virtue intact for her betrothed.Well, the one thing that attracted me to the story was the outline. As most of these stories go, I thought I could have predicted what happened, but unfortunately, I think my assumption was probably a better story than this. I found the story to be trite, shallow, messy, and incredibly misogynistic. I know well that most romance stories have a bit of misogyny in them, but this one was pretty thick with it.Let me start with the storytelling. It's messy in that it is constantly vacillating point of views. One paragraph is through Gwendolyn's eyes, the next is Hakon, and then the next one is some chambermaid in the same room giving her $0.02. So it goes on. It took me many chapters to get used to it. And yes, I did read the whole thing (mainly in hopes to see a redeeming quality in the couple).And the descriptions, whoa. Adverbs stacked on adjectives stacked on adverbs. I like description, but most of it felt forced or trite, as if there was a book of synonyms on the ready for *every* sentence.Also, the beginning of the story held a lot of completely unnecessary crap. If the story is not going to be about Wulfgar and Anora, maybe one should stop writing such intricate details about their history and the political notions of it all. When it doesn't last past the first few chapters, never to be touched upon again, I feel like my time is wasted with pointless words completely lacking in entertainment or reason.The twins' ruse was poorly written. I believe another reviewer noticed the same. How can the both be so incredibly fair and beautiful and gorgeous and gifts of the gods when one can be so easily mistaken for a young boy? I absolutely hated Hakon as a character, but it was laughable to read the spew of compliments he would bestow upon Anora, then hate so easily on Garric without any inkling of her identity, then praise Gwendolyn (as Anora) exactly the same - never the wiser! Yet every chapter some background character made a comment on how absolutely magnificent and awe-inspiring was the beauty of either...but only if they were in a dress. /eyeroll/ Put some pants on a girl and she's too mannish to believed to be a girl. Riiiiight.Now to the 'romance' of Gwendolyn and Hakon. Not once did I feel any genuine love between the two. For chapters, Hakon praises his affections and lust for Anora, from the very beginning. When they are first discovered on the ship, the reader anticipates a kind captain with morals, but instead the reader gets an arrogant warrior who's okay with raping and taking some hostages as slaves. While I get his reasons for not turning around and dropping the twins back off at England, did he really have to enforce slavery? Not only slavery, but insist on getting Anora to bed him as some kind of sex slave (incredibly confidently, I might add). I get that this was probably exactly the kind of man one would expect in this era, but it's not very attractive to read about in a romance novel. So not only is he constantly forcing his affections on an incredibly frightened Anora and just scaring the bejeezus out of her with his talks of forcing himself upon her, but he doesn't even get a whiff of difference when Anora and Gwendolyn change places. Absolutely nothing is amiss to him. The first night Hakon and Gwendolyn (as Anora) are together...it's just very...rape-y. He does force himself...but it's some kind of weird thing that Gwendolyn (all this time has completely hated and disgusted by this guy) just turns over like a cat in heat all of a sudden. I think, as a reader, one is supposed to just accept that her body knows what's best for her heart...or something like that? Even through the realization of love and all that, Hakon never knows who's who. I mean, I would think true love should at least be able to see a person past their indescribably beautiful body to fall in love with someone and then fall in love with an identical someone without realizing the difference. It just leaves the romance's credibility in the negative.This also applies to Gwendolyn. The reader does not come across her transition into loving him. She's wishy washy and just moody. She hates him because he took her and her sister as slaves away from her homeland! She loves him because he's great in the sack! She hates him because he's so mean to her when she's Garric. She loves him because just look at that hot, Viking body! Once she starts pretending to be Anora, all plans to escape home are just gone. Months are supposed to go by, and Anora is just sitting on her thumbs trusting her sister. I just don't get it. I don't get any precourse to love beyond lust or obligation/duty/honor above whatever it is that feels good.I mentioned the first scene of intimacy between Hakon and Gwendolyn are...rape-y. Well, the acceptance of rape was one of the biggest themes that disturbed me. It wasn't outright acceptance, per se, but it was darn close. The constant attempts to rape the twins were disheartening, but then to have the 'hero' consider it so much...yeah, not cool. One line from a background character left me doing double takes:""Whatever happened to the days when a Viking chieftain took a wench if he wanted her, and that was that! She closed her heavy-lidded eyes, a secret smile on her face, as she remembered her youth.""This particular quote in context implies that Hakon should just go ahead and rape Anora, because he's so good looking and rich and a spectacular lover, the rape will be null and void because the wench in question will love it.Yeah...this is just a horrible impression for a romance novel...and towards the 'good guy' especially.Again, I believe another reviewer also noticed the abundance of Gwendolyn's stupidity. Keep getting in trouble by walking around alone? Just keep doing it! Yeah! Not only is it a poor setup for danger, but it's also poor characterization. Need the heroine to come across the bad guy? Just write in there that she's walking around for funsies. Maybe she can not learn her lesson and do it again later...a few more times, at that.There was one line in an (albeit decent) scene of war: ""Acting on finely honed instincts..."" referring to Gwendolyn in fight. I literally laughed out loud. ""Finely honed"" indeed.A great line that's later in the book, after already been in danger numerous times:""Perhaps a walk would take her mind off the memories that continually plagued her. Aye, that was what she would do!""Such excitement for a walk!!! She must know that danger and excitement are ahead whenever she goes out alone! Good one, Gwennie!So why two stars instead of one? I read the whole thing and still hoped for a romantic redemption. I really wanted Hakon to be a decent guy. I really wanted true love to peek it's cute little head and yell, ""Surprise! I really AM here!"" If the story was just an outline, I would have enjoyed it better, because I really do like the premise. If only I had a trophy in poor execution...Lacking characters, lacking writing, overwrought descriptions, glorifying rape, zero hero/heroine presence...and thusly.Thank Odin it was free.","Identical twin sisters Gwendolyn and Anora are complete opposites, but fierce friends nonetheless.

"This is the first Star Wars novel I've read since the wonderfully adapted novelization of Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover. Sadly, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice does not inspire me to continue reading expanded universe novels. While many readers find fault with the brief length of this novel, I found it to be the book's only saving grace (other than its price). Surprisingly, the characters in this novel are quite lackluster and are a far cry from the variety of Sith Lords we're accustomed to. Whereas the Sith Lords of the Star Wars films and previous EU books tend to be frightening figures, the 'humanized' Sith Lords in ""Precipice"" are poor ambassadors of the Dark Side of the Force.Perhaps this series will improve with successive books. But Precipice fails to deliver the kind of intriguing space opera that I love about Star Wars. Fortunately, Fate of the Jedi: Omen of which Precipice is only a prequel, appears to be a far more interesting read. As much as it pains me to say it, I would have a very difficult time recommending this book to anyone except the most die-hard Star Wars fan.

I was excited about this book.I read it cover to cover so to speak .. in about 35 minutes.Bleh.Being the second book in the Jane Porter series, this picked up right where the first left off.Jane is a woman who was celibate for 2 years.

"Even though I recently just found Ms. Andre as a writer of erotica and erotic, I absolutely love her books.  This one was no exception.  I enjoyed the premise of three friends on a weekend in wine country, CA.  The description of the vineyards and town made me want to visit the area.  Each character has about 1/3 of the book devoted to her; each story within the book was very good and different.  I loved the first two characters in the first and second parts: Carrie and Rose . . . absolutely fell in love with the chef for more reasons than one, gee he cooks!  Rose's story was the most believable to me (though who really cares how believable it was).  Vanessa was my least favorite character, matter of fact; I really didn't care for her at all until the end, then I changed my mind about her.  However, FOR ME, Vanessa's weekend was by far, one of the most erotic stories I have ever read . . . the words, scenarios and feelings portrayed were beautiful; at one point, I had tears running down my cheeks because the writing was so poignant . . . wow!

"In a sort of Romeo and Juliet spirit, Sydney (Juliet),  from a hunter family, falls in love with Jason (Romeo) a werewolf. She has dreamed of him over the years and meeting Jake in person, she falls in instant lust. They consume their relationship pretty quickly and he bites her, therefore starting her transformation into a full-fledged werewolf.Meanwhile, her father keeps trying to get her to hunt and kill werewolves.The hunters, who know full well the wolves they are trying to kill are human, are shown as uneducated rednecks, whose collective IQ is less than 100. The werewolves are not much better. Why they would want to run wild in the woods when they know they're in danger is never quite explained. One would think that they would have leaned to control their instinct in order to survive. Or at least do something to stop the hunt (politics, law-making and media relation anyone?)But there's worse. The relationship between Sidney and her father is unhealthy and made me cringe. She's an immature little girl looking for Daddy's attention and he does not listen nor takes her feelings seriously. Pathetic.I did not find anything funny about this story and recommend you skip it.",The werewolves are not much better.

"The story itself wasn't bad, but it was too short and the ending a bit of a disappointment. The author did a reasonable job with the wrap up but it just didn't fall together all too well. Not bad of a price tag for the content, though knocking an extra 50 cents off would have increased my rating. All in all not bad but too short.","The story itself wasn't bad, but it was too short and the ending a bit of a disappointment.

"I thought this would be a pleasantly spine-tingling read for the Halloween season.  It was a good book, no question about it, but it didn't have the feeling of suspense and/or thrill that I was expecting from the description.  There was plenty of build-up regarding the wood, but very little actual action within the borders of the wood.  The story of the 'haunted' wood was more a backdrop (and deus ex machina, I'm afraid) for the story of Izzy and her abusive ex-husband.  Most readers will enjoy the story so long as they aren't expecting something more in line with 'horror'.  The writing was done well, the characters were believeable, though not always likeable (I personally did not LIKE Izzy at all, though I could sympathize with her), and Kindle formatting was fine.  The writing was worth probably 4 stars, but I took one off due to the fact that this was promoted as more of a 'horror' or 'suspense' genre, which it really wasn't.","It was a good book, no question about it, but it didn't have the feeling of suspense and/or thrill that I was expecting from the description.

"I thought this book started out fairly well.About half way through there came one plot element/device that pretty much occupied the rest of the story.That's okay, but not great.  It left me with the feeling that not too much happened.The world seemed a bit thin and there were few compelling allusions to anything greater and deeper churning within the as-yet-untold-story behind the story.I waffled a bit between a 3 & a 4 rating, but I did enjoy the read, so I opted for the 4.As other commenters mentioned, there's a lot of hiccups to the writing due to incorrect grammar and occasionally the narrative will shift very temporarily to first person and jolt the reader out of the story.There's also that horrible horrible war between 'effect' and 'affect' that is rampant within this book.  These words are commonly misused within the book, which obviously irritated other reviewers more than it did me, yet I was not completely immune.What bothered me more was the lack of characterization and rationale for the actions of certain characters.  Some characters seemed stupid-angry simply because it was the only way to advance the plot in the direction the author wanted.Obviously I liked the book in certain ways.  I liked the main character.  I liked the process in which he began making a place for himself in his world.  I liked the relationships he had with several of his peers (and I liked several of those peers).  I liked the general description of the world.  I even liked the beginning of the main conflict, and a bit of the middle of the main conflict (though it seemed to drag on at some points).The question is how much promise does this author and this series have?  Will I pay $2.99 for the second book in the series?Right now I'm leaning against it.But if my current stash of $0.99 fiction runs dry, it will be in the realm of possibility.","""I thought this book started out fairly well.About half way through there came one plot element/device that pretty much occupied the rest of the story.

"This is the story of Jek, who was like a sex god in The Empress' New Clothes. The title comes from what Jek tells Brynda when she reveals she has cancer and is given a short time to live. He tells her ""no fear"" as he explains how much more advanced his race is than Earth. Also this book is pretty short to be $8 but I love the series so its worth it.","This is the story of Jek, who was like a sex god in The Empress' New Clothes.

"Heat of the Moment is the first book in the Out of Uniform series by author Elle Kennedy.If you are looking for a full length novel, look elsewhere.  This novella is just that -- a short story.  It comes in  at 78 pages according to Amazon and I want to mention that it is even shorter than that since the last 10 percent maybe of the book is previews for other stories.This is a sexy and short M/F/M menage read.  The main couple is John Garrett and Shelby Harper with the third person involved is Carson Scott. After pining for each other for a year, Shelby finally invites John and Carson up to her place after closing time.  She had the cafe open during a heat wave for the service men and she over hears Carson and John talking about how vanilla Shelby probably is.  Shelby is convinced to show them how un-vanilla she is by acting out her fantasy of two men at one time.I really enjoyed this short story and the writer made it believable.  While Carson was more of a third wheel in the story, he was a pivotal player in getting these two together.  Even though it does feature instant love after one night together with a small glitch of insecurities, I could actually see these two people together for the long haul.While it was in no means a book that will be above others, I will say that this short story was a great start to being introduced to this author for the first time.  If this had been a full length novel, I am sure it would have rated higher in my opinion. New readers of this author will get a quick thrill with John and Shelby and will be wanting to follow it up with the next novella in the series.","""Heat of the Moment"" is the first book in the Out of Uniform series by author Elle Kennedy.If you are looking for a full length novel, look elsewhere.

"As I read this story I felt like a fan watching a crash at a NASCAR race. I kept trying to look away but I was drawn to see just how bad it could be. As 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' was to movies, this book is to Science Fiction.Stilted dialogue, complete ignorance of military aspects, one dimensional characters, abysmal grasp of science, a concept military vehicle that is so totally implausible that I laughed out loud, all blended together with a bizarre world view of how people behave. I kept thinking that the author was either brilliantly satirizing and mocking survivalist thinking or he was a horrifically bad writer. I still don't know.I gave the story two stars because the author made me determined to read book two of the series to find out.","'Plan Nine From Outer Space' is to Science Fiction.Stilted dialogue, complete ignorance of military aspects, one dimensional characters, abysmal grasp of science, a concept military vehicle that is so totally "
"I downloaded both this book and the Bootscootin' Box Set at the same time.  I barely made it through this book, though it was slightly better than the others in the series.  The rest of the series just gets more and more ridiculous as it goes along and I couldn't finish it.  I agree with the other reviewers who suggest a good editor.","I downloaded both this book and the Bootscootin' Box Set at the same time.

"Review contains spoilersThe premise of the story sounded great. Two men who grew up together, one gay, the other straight have to marry/bond for their clans to strike a peace. You see the guys aren't just guys they are werewolves. So, we have two great cliches in one story: 1.) forced arranged marriage and 2.) paranormal/werewolves.However, while the story has some hot chemistry between the two leads, Hayden and Josh, the overall drama is told in flashbacks, which take away from the present day tale. Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless. So I can only give the book 3 stars. The premise had promise, but did not come to full frution.","The premise of the story sounded great.

"This is probably material for a Woody Allen movie (I don't like his movies). David missed Woodstock, and messed everything up with the girl he had a super crush on, all because he was too cautious and scared. He grows up to a boring middle management type job, wife, kids etc but has never gotton over missing Woodstock.Now, 40 years later the crush girl, who has become famous, has waltzed or at least emailed her way into his life. He agonizes over every email he sends her, wanting the wording to be perfect. He plans to see her, and they will attend the Woodstock Reunion and everything will be right. Except that isn't what happens. Pretty much nothing happens.There are other free books out there that are worthy of more stars. I suggest you find one of those.","This is probably material for a Woody Allen movie (I don't like his movies).
